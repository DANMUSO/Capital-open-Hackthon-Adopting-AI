**AI-Driven Movies Recommendation Solution Platform -   Capital Open Hackathon Adopting AI.**

My team and I have developed an AI-powered recommendation system that heavily relies on insights derived from the shared data.

I've presented a detailed analysis demonstrating how we extracted valuable insights from the provided data, encapsulated within the document titled "AI-Driven Movie Recommendation Platform.pptx.

**We categorized the recommendations into three groups.**

The first category within the AI-driven Movies Recommendation Solution Platform is an online platform where users receive movie suggestions based on the films' average ratings. These movies are presented in descending order from highly popular to less popular ones.

In the second category, upon users' login, they receive personalized recommendations aligned with their movie ratings.

The third category showcases movies positioned just beneath the tailored recommendations. These selections are recommended to users based on ratings provided by other users.

**We implemented an AI-driven Movie Recommendation Solution Platform using the Laravel PHP Framework and deployed it on an AWS cloud-computing infrastructure**
This step was taken to guarantee the platform's high availability, accessibility, and scalability.

To access the platform, please utilize the provided IP address and port.

The image illustrates three distinct segments. The initial section exhibits a slideshow presenting movie images. The second section provides a command-line interface (CLI) or a space for users to input their names. Finally, the last section is designated for showcasing overall recommendations derived from the average ratings of movies.

**There is a form for the user to log in or register if he doesn't have an account.** 

Once a user logs in to the AI-driven Movies Recommendation Solution Platform, they receive personalized recommendations that are tailored according to their own movie ratings.

We've chosen three users—Alice, Bob, and Mia—from the provided dataset to serve as case studies. To highlight the variations in personalized recommendations among these users, I've included three screenshots displaying unique recommendations for each individual.

Through meticulous data analysis, we acquired valuable insights that facilitated the implementation of personalized, user-specific collaborative recommendations for each individual.
